          1. What is CORS?

        <div className="collapse-content text-justify">
          <p className="mb-3">
            Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web
            applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with
            resources in a different domain. With CORS support, one can build
            rich client-side web applications and selectively allow cross-origin
            access resources resides in a different server.{" "}
          </p>{" "}
          <p className="mb-3">
            An example of a cross-origin request: the front-end JavaScript code
            served from https://domain-a.com uses <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> to
            make a request for https://domain-b.com/data.json.{" "}
          </p>{" "}
          <p>
            For security reasons, browsers don't allow cross-origin HTTP
            requests from scripts. For example, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and
            the Fetch API follow the same-origin policy. This means that a web
            application using those APIs can only request resources from the
            same origin the application was loaded from unless the response from
            other origins includes the right CORS headers.

          2. Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
          implement authentication?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content text-justify">
          <p className="mb-3">
            Answer: Among many other things firebase provides authentication
            system to be used by developers. Firebase's authentication system is
            secure. So, developers can use it without creating their own
            authentication system.
          </p>{" "}
          <p className="mb-3">
            Other than firebase, we can implement authentication system by using
            the following services.

          3. How does the private route work?
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content text-justify">
          <p className="mb-3">
            Private Routes or Protected Routes in React Router require a user
            being authorized to visit a route. So, if a user is not authorized
            for a specific page, he cannot access it. The most common example is
            authentication in a React application where a user can only access
            the protected pages when they are authorized (which means in this
            case being authenticated). In order to achieve this, a private route
            component is declared, and all private routes are passed as children
            of private route component.

          4. What is Node? How does Node work?

          <p className="mb-3">
            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime
            environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
            It is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is
            used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            When we normally think of JavaScript, our mind tends to go to web
            development. Until Node.js came along, there was really no way to
            run JavaScript outside of a browser. When we write a backend server
            and database, Node.js is a popular choice because we can run our
            code as a standalone application rather than something that can only
            be evaluated in a browser environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Node.js is an important tool for any JavaScript developer to
            understand. So, today, weâ€™ll introduce you to Node.js and show you
            how to get started with a project.
